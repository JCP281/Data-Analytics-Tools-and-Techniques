    Description:  The Alcohol Epidemiologic Data Directory [PDF] is compiled by the Alcohol Epidemiologic Data System (AEDS). The                           directory is a current listing of surveys and other relevant data suitable for epidemiologic research on alcohol. Most                     data sets described in this document are national in scope. In some cases, however, select specialized data sets may be                   included.

    Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/number-of-drug-and-alcohol-related-intoxication-deaths-by-county-of-incident-2007-2013-2ab0c   
    Description:    Drug and alcohol-related Intoxication death data is prepared using drug and alcohol intoxication data housed in a                         registry developed and maintained by the Vital Statistics Administration (VSA) of the Maryland                                             Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). The methodology for reporting on drug-related intoxication deaths in                       Maryland was developed by VSA with assistance from the DHMH Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration, the Office of the                       Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) and the Maryland Poison Control Center. Assistance was also provided by authors of a                         2008 Baltimore City Health Department report on intoxication deaths. Data in this table is by incident location, where                     the death occurred, rather than by county of residence.
